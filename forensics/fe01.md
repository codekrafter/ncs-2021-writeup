# FE01

## Briefing

Download the file and find a way to get the flag.

Contents: **fe01.ost**

## Walkthrough

This challenge gives us an `.ost` file, which is a form of outlook storage. Doing some online googling I found out that there are a few different tools to open them, the one I chose was Kernel OST Viewer. Digging through the emails I eventually found one with `flag.zip`, but it is password protected. The email containing the file says:

> Here it is. The p/w is the same one I gave to you in the office when we  arranged Fridays meeting. You still have that right? 

I searched a few more emails in that thread and found nothing, so I opened up the calendar to see if it was there. In the calendar there was an event called "Meeting with Chris", which contained a string: `c]5p@S7K/z}Z!Q`. When tested, that is the password to the zip file, which contains a file named `flag.jpg`, which when opened shows the following:
