# FE02

## Briefing

We're sure there's a flag at `cfta-fe02.allyourbases.co` - can you find it?

## Walkthrough

This gives a URL, which when visited returns a DNS error (the current version of the challenge has a webpage that says you should look elsewhere). My first instinct was to run `nslookup` on the domain, which returns nothing useful. Since it was giving a DNS error I thought the challenge must be related to DNS, so I ran `nslookup -type=txt` to query DNS text records. This returned the following:

```bash
$ nslookup -type=txt cfta-fe02.allyourbases.co                                                                
Server:         172.31.160.1
Address:        172.31.160.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
cfta-fe02.allyourbases.co       text = "flag=unlimited_free_texts"
