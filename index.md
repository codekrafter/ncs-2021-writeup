### Introduction

From April 5th to April 7th I participated in this year's National Cyber Scholarship Competition, a competitive CTF (or Capture-The-Flag) that centers on cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I ended up placing 52nd out of 3,277 high school students who participated:

For my first competitive timed CTF, I think I did pretty well. This website serves to document my approach to the challenges that I completed. Here is a list of challenges I have written walkthroughs for:

## My Setup

For this CTF I used 2 main environments, my main windows desktop and a Kali Linux VM. I ran the VM using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and used [Win-KeX Win](https://www.kali.org/docs/wsl/win-kex-win/) to host the Kali VM GUI in a window instead of running it as a headless server.
